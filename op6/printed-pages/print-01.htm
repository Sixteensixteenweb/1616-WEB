						<em class="para--title">Memories And Premonitions</em> gathers the
						practice of three artists reflecting on physical and spiritual
						temporalities, autoscopic phenomena and transcending the body. This

							title="Gallery44 Exhibitions"
							>Shedding Heaviness</a

						Heaviness and Memories And Premonitions features the work of
						<a class="link--secondary" href="#artistbio1">Julianna A.S.</a>,
						<a class="link--secondary" href="#artistbio2">Delali Cofie</a> and
						<a class="link--secondary" href="#artistbio3">Kourtney Jackson</a>.
					</p>

					<p id="artistbio1">
						<em class="para--title">Julianna A.S.</em> is an Afro-Caribbean
						woman working at the intersection of art and scientific research.
						Her work reimagines the practice of art making and uses woodwork,
						photography and curriculum-based interventions to explore intuitive
						cognition, physics and cultural imprint. Through her work, she
						invites viewers to question and engage with the intricate
						connections between art, science, and the human experience.
					</p>
					<p id="artistbio2">
						<em class="para--title">Delali Cofie</em> is a Ghanaian-Nigerian
						photographer currently living in Toronto, Canada. Through
						storytelling he engages in multiple genres of photography such as
						fine art, documentary, and fashion. His personal work presents
						subtle beauty whilst exploring themes of family, self-formation and
						community. Frequently creating work between his native city Accra
						and current city Toronto, his work tells a tale of two cities,
						linked by a diasporic thread. His work has been exhibited in
						galleries across Ontario, namely Gallery 44 (2021) and Gallery 101
						(2022). He was featured in legendary Ghanaian photographer James
						Barnor’s exhibition catalogue at the Arles Photography Festival
						(2022). Delali had his first solo exhibition, A Place of Ours,
						included in the CONTACT Photography festival in Toronto (2022) and
						created commissioned work for the Royal Bank of Canada. He is
						currently completing a BFA in Photography at OCAD University.
					</p>
					<p id="artistbio3">
						<em class="para--title">Kourtney Jackson</em> is a Toronto-based
						filmmaker and lens-based artist. Her artistic practice employs
						hybridized and experimental forms of storytelling that permeate
						interiorities of Black queer womanhood. In lieu of “representation”
						as a means for legibility, her work endeavours toward a repatriation
						of the self through somatic, spiritual, and ecological
						sensibilities. Her award-winning films have screened locally and
						internationally at festivals including TIFF Next Wave (Toronto),
						BlackStar Film Festival (Philadelphia), Sundance Film Festival,
						Ignite x Adobe (Utah), and the Rencontres Internationales du
						Documentaire de Montréal (Montréal).
