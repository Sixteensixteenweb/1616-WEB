				<p id="artistbio1">
					<em class="para--title">Julianna A.S.</em> is an Afro-Caribbean woman working at the intersection of art and scientific research. Her work reimagines the practice of art making and uses woodwork, photography and curriculum-based interventions to explore intuitive cognition, physics and cultural imprint. Through her work, she invites viewers to question and engage with the intricate connections between art, science, and the human experience.
				</p>
				<p id="artistbio2">
					<em class="para--title">Delali Cofie</em> is a Ghanaian-Nigerian photographer currently living in Toronto, Canada. Through storytelling he engages in multiple genres of photography such as fine art, documentary, and fashion. His personal work presents subtle beauty whilst exploring themes of family, self-formation and community. Frequently creating work between his native city Accra and current city Toronto, his work tells a tale of two cities, linked by a diasporic thread. His work has been exhibited in galleries across Ontario, namely Gallery 44 (2021) and Gallery 101 (2022). He was featured in legendary Ghanaian photographer James Barnor’s exhibition catalogue at the Arles Photography Festival (2022). Delali had his first solo exhibition, A Place of Ours, included in the CONTACT Photography festival in Toronto (2022) and created commissioned work for the Royal Bank of Canada. He is currently completing a BFA in Photography at OCAD University.

				<p id="artistbio3">
					<em class="para--title">Kourtney Jackson</em> is a Toronto-based filmmaker and lens-based artist. Her artistic practice employs hybridized and experimental forms of storytelling that permeate interiorities of Black queer womanhood. In lieu of “representation” as a means for legibility, her work endeavours toward a repatriation of the self through somatic, spiritual, and ecological sensibilities. Her award-winning films have screened locally and internationally at festivals including TIFF Next Wave (Toronto), BlackStar Film Festival (Philadelphia), Sundance Film Festival, Ignite x Adobe (Utah), and the Rencontres Internationales du Documentaire de Montréal (Montréal).
